# TDS_Project_1

- This project uses the GitHub API to scrape data on users in Sydney with over 100 followers.
- The analysis revealed that JavaScript is the most popular programming language among these users.
- I recommend developers enhance their GitHub profiles to increase visibility and engagement.
